# Framing UK Immigration: The Agenda-Setting Influence of British Newspapers and Reddit

This repo contains the code for my masters' dissertation. I include notebooks for collecting and cleaning Reddit comments (which involves decompressing 
.zst files downloaded from Academic Torrent dump), and Newspaper articles (scraped/API). Data analysis encompasses 4 files, two files that conduct BERTopic Modelling
for news and Reddit respectively, one for additional analysis on issue frame prevalence for newspapers by political leaning, and the last file containing analysis for VAR modelling
and Granger-causality. I also attach interactive intertopic distance maps and cosine similarity maps for better visualisation of the topics.
